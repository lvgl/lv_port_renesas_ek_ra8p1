## Getting started

### Hardware setup
- Mount the graphics expansion board to the mainboard.
- Connect a USB C cable to DEBUG1 (J10) and your PC.

### Software setup
- [Install e2 studio 2025-04.1 or newer (important) for your OS](https://www.renesas.com/en/software-tool/e2studio-information-rz-family).
  On Linux, Ubuntu 22.04 or newer is required.
  - When prompted, choose "Custom Install".
  - Ensure "RA" is included in your selection of "Device Families" to install.
  - Ensure "Renesas FSP Smart Configurator Core" and "Renesas FSP Smart Configurator ARM"
    are included in your selection of "Customize Features".
  - Ensure "LLVM Embedded Toolchain for Arm 18.1.3" is selected.
- Install FSP Packs. v6.0.0 is required.
  - On Windows, simply download FSP_Packs_v6.0.0.exe
    [from here](https://github.com/renesas/fsp/releases) under "Assets" for the desired release.
    Run the installer and follow the prompts.
  - On Linux, download FSP_Packs_v6.0.0.zip
    [from here](https://github.com/renesas/fsp/releases) under "Assets" for the desired release.
    Locate the e2 studio install location. If it is `~/.local/share/renesas/e2_studio`
    and the ZIP download is `~/Downloads/FSP_Packs_v6.0.0.zip`, unzip the file
    with the following commands:
    ```shell
    cd ~/.local/share/renesas/e2_studio
    unzip ~/Downloads/FSP_Packs_v6.0.0.zip
    ```
    The directory structure in the ZIP overlaps with the
    e2_studio install location. This is expected. The `unzip` process will
    update the directory structure with the new FSP files from the ZIP and preserve any existing FSP packs.

### Run the project
- Clone the repository
  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/lvgl/lv_port_renesas_ek_ra8p1.git
  ```
- Open e2 studio and go to **File > Open Projects from File System...**. Click "Directory"
  and navigate to the cloned project and then click "Finish".
- Click the hammer to build the project. If it is greyed-out, first single-click the project
  "lv_ek_ra8p1" in the left sidebar and the hammer should become clickable.
- To upload and run the project, click the bug (debug) icon. The debugger will break (stop execution)
  at the beginning. Click the "Resume" button to continue execution.
- To upload the optimized Release version of the build, open the dropdown next to the bug
  icon and click "Debug Configurations...". Change the "C/C++ Application:" to start with
  "Release/" instead of "Debug/". It's also recommended to set the "Build Configuration:"
  to "Release". Remember to change these settings back if you want a good experience debugging
  the app.

### Debugging
- In the previous section, the project was run using the debugger.
  Simply continue using the interactive debugger in e2 studio to debug your program.
  Set breakpoints, continue, step, etc. as with any other Eclipse-based IDE.

## Notes

e2 studio has a configurator to adjust configuration settings. If you want to change an
LVGL config, first check if it's an option present in the FSP Configuratior. To get there,
open the "FSP Configuration" perspective by clicking the tab in the very top-right corner
of the window. Next, open "configuration.xml" by double-clicking it in the "Project Explorer".
When you are done, make sure to click "Generate Project Content".
For all other configs, `src/lv_conf_user.h` is the file to edit. `ra_cfg\fsp_cfg\lvgl\lvgl\lv_conf.h` includes this file
and has some defaults which will be set if they are not explicitly set in `src/lv_conf_user.h`.
To see all the possible LVGL configs, look at `./ra/lvgl/lvgl/lv_conf_template.h`.

LVGL comes from the FSP so the source code will appear upon building. It can be edited
in-place, but changes will be lost if a "clean" is performed.

LVGL logging and `printf` goes to a virtual serial port with baud 115200 over the USB debug connection.
You can open any serial terminal on your PC to view it.
